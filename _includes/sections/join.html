    <h2><strong>Join the Lab</strong></h2>
    <p>The Lee Lab is actively seeking graduate students. Prospective graduate students should directly contact Dr. Kevin Lee and apply either through the Biological Sciences (M.S./Ph.D.) or the Molecular Cellular Biology (Ph.D.) programs.</p>
    <p>The Lee lab is also seeking the dedicated undergraduate students.  Prospective undergraduate research assistants (RA), will l learn standard molecular biology techniques (gel electrophoresis, PCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry), as well as cell culture, mouse genetics, state of the art confocal microscopy, and lineage tracing analysis.</p>

    <h3 class="center"><strong>Duties of undergraduate research assistants</strong></h2>
    <p>Commit approximately 8-10 hours per week on a flexible basis to work in the lab. This work is designed to address some of the issues described above and also serves as pilot work for our patient studies. RA’s typically work in concert with Dr. Lee, Dr. Sharma and other members of the laboratory in the laboratory. Each RA is assigned to one project, usually based on their expressed preference after hearing about the current projects. RA’s are trained on how to use the equipment, run the experiments, and analyze the data. They are expected to read the current literature related to their project and participate in weekly lab meetings. Students who have completed some course work in biology and physiology are given preference. Familiarity with PC-based computers is a plus. Research assistant positions will begin as experience-gaining volunteer opportunities, with the possibility of moving into a paid or for-credit arrangement. RAs are also encouraged to complete their honor’s thesis in the lab. Given the amount of training involved, we prefer students who anticipate being able to work in the lab for at least one full year.</p>
