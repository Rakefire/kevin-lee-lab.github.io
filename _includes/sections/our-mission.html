    <p class="editable"><img width="200" height="200" src="/images/hands.jpg" /> Obesity, defined by the accumulation of excess body fat, is dramatically increasing worldwide and is driving an epidemic of type 2 diabetes.&nbsp; Adipose tissue and obesity are more complex than previously believed, and recent studies have shown adipose tissue is comprised of developmentally and functionally distinct subpopulations of adipocytes. To investigate this cellular heterogeneity, our lab has developed novel cellular and mouse to identify and study subpopulations of white adipocytes both <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo.</em> These studies have uncovered <em>three</em> distinct subpopulations of white adipocytes. The central goal of my laboratory is to understand at a molecular and cellular level what accounts for heterogeneity between white adipocyte subpopulations and to study the effect these different adipocyte subpopulations have on systemic metabolism.&nbsp; Knowledge gained from this research will aid in the identification of specific markers and the development of therapeutic approaches to combat the metabolic disorders associated with obesity.&nbsp;</p>
