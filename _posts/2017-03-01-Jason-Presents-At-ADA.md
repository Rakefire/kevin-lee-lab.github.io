At the American Diabetes Association (ADA) meeting this June in San Diego, both of Jason’s studies "Growth Hormone Regulation of G0S2 and FSP27: Mechanism for Growth Hormone–Mediated Lipolysis" and "Characterizing the Wilms Tumor 1 (Wt1) Adipose Subpopulation" will be showcased in Moderated Poster Discussions.  Good job, Jason!
